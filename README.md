# color_gradient
A Fun Little Program for the Joy of It

As soon as the program is started, a small window appears. At the center of which a single grey pixel is located. Then, progressively, a surrounding pixel is selected and assigned a color close to the pixel it was selected next to. Rince and repeat. 

To add a little bit fun, one can click on any colored pixel, and in a small radius around it all colored pixels are erased.

Have fun!
